# Project52: 52 weeks, 52 projects!

A challenge to release a small project every week for 52 weeks. All projects are written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Preface

I found a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kkdai/project52) on this challenge and felt inspired to do the same in order to grow my Go skills. My aim is to build different types of projects in order to improve the range of my skills.

## Constraints

Here are the constraints of Project52:

- The project could be big or small, but it must be something new. Choose something you can finish within a week.
- You can use any programming language you like or even a mix of languages.
- You don't need to come up with a brand new idea. You could recreate an existing idea or project.

## Progress (13/04/2020~)

1. (13/04/2020) [Gocorona: Coronavirus Statistics Dashboard for your Terminal](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/gocorona) - Track the latest Coronavirus (COVID-19) statistics from the command line.
2. (24/04/2020) [Golife: A Game of Life project](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/golife) - Simulate John Conway's Game of Life in the terminal.
3. (30/04/2020) [Spotcli: Spotify Listening History Data](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/spotcli) - Grab music listening history data from Spotify and save to a MongoDB instance for future analysis.
4. (24/05/2020) [Goname: A command line batch renaming tool](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/goname) - Batch rename files and directories safely from the command line.
5. (07/06/2020) [Life](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/life) - Convert between Game of Life pattern formats.
